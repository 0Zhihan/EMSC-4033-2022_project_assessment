## EMSC4033/EMSC8033 - Computational Geosciences: Problem-solving, Logical Thinking and Programming

## Semester 1, 2022

Hello, I am Zhihan Liu. I have written some codes to explore relationships between some variables and organized them in folders. let me introduce them to you.


The complete code(`code.py`) for the entire project is in the **code** folder. 

The project plan(`Projectplanner.md`) and project report(`ProjectReport.md`) are in the **Project** folder. 

In `Projectplanner.md`, I clearly describe executive summary, goals and requirements, background and innovation, resources, timeline and testing plan of this project. 
In `ProjectReport.md`, I clearly describe instructions, dependencies, testing, limitations and future improvments of this project. 


`Run_project.ipynb`, `Run_test.ipynb`, `test_function.py`, `data.txt` and **src** folder are in **Notebook** folder. The test functions are written in `test_function.py` and some data I used are stored in `data.txt`. We can run the code for whole projects in `Run_project.ipynb` and run the code for tests in `Run_test.ipynb`. 

`my_functions.py` and  `dependencies.py` are in **src** folder. The functions I defined are written in `my_functions.py` and dependencies I used are in `dependencies.py`.
